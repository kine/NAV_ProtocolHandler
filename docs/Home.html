<p><strong>Project Description</strong><br>
Target of this project is to develop DYNAMICSNAV protocol handler which will solve problems of side-by-side installation of many NAV versions on one PC. Today only one version could be handled through the hyperlinks. &uml;</p>
<p><br>
Current functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activate/Deactivate handler </li><li>If URI for DynamicsNAV protocol is triggered from classic client:
<ul>
<li>Correct build of RTC is started with the URI </li><li>When URI does not include server name and instance name, mapping is used to add them
</li></ul>
</li><li>If URI is started from another app:
<ul>
<li>default version will be used to open the URI </li></ul>
</li><li>Mappings could be edited through button on main form </li><li>Mappings are saved as XML file on selected disk (defined in .config file) </li></ul>
